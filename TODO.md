# TODO - Directory Manager Improvements

## Code Quality Improvements

- [ ] Add type hints throughout the codebase (filesystem.py, fsnode.py, utils.py)
- [ ] Fix @staticmethod decorators on factory methods in FSNode class
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling for invalid paths, missing files, etc.
- [ ] Add detailed docstrings to all methods for professional documentation
- [ ] Code review and refactoring for consistency

## Testing & Validation

- [ ] Create unit tests using pytest
  - [ ] Test FSNode creation and operations
  - [ ] Test FileSystem search methods
  - [ ] Test path finding algorithms
  - [ ] Test duplicate detection
- [ ] Add edge case tests
  - [ ] Empty directories
  - [ ] Large file sizes
  - [ ] Invalid inputs
  - [ ] Malformed paths
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks with actual timing results
- [ ] Add test data generation for stress testing

## Enhanced Features

- [ ] Add CLI interface using argparse
  - [ ] Interactive file system builder
  - [ ] Command-line search operations
  - [ ] Batch file operations
- [ ] Improve file size formatting (KB/MB/GB display)
- [ ] Add export functionality
  - [ ] JSON export of directory structure
  - [ ] XML export option
  - [ ] CSV export for file listings
- [ ] Add file metadata support
  - [ ] Creation/modification timestamps
  - [ ] File permissions simulation
  - [ ] Custom attributes

## Documentation Enhancements

- [ ] Create requirements.txt file
- [ ] Add sample data files for testing and demonstration
- [ ] Include performance comparison charts in README
- [ ] Add code examples for each major feature
- [ ] Create API documentation

## Portfolio Enhancement

- [ ] Add screenshots/GIFs of program execution
- [ ] Create visual diagrams of data structures used
- [ ] Mention specific algorithmic concepts applied
- [ ] Add complexity analysis diagrams
- [ ] Link to related coursework or projects
- [ ] Add deployment/installation instructions

## Future Considerations

- [ ] Database persistence layer
- [ ] Multi-threading for large directory operations
- [ ] Memory optimization for large file systems
- [ ] GUI interface using tkinter or similar
- [ ] Web interface using Flask/FastAPI
- [ ] File compression simulation
- [ ] Network file system simulation

## Priority Order

1. **High Priority**: Type hints, unit tests, error handling
2. **Medium Priority**: CLI interface, improved documentation
3. **Low Priority**: GUI, web interface, advanced features
